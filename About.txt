A Code Repository is a Program responsible for managing source code resources, e.g., files and documents. A fully developed Repository will support file persistance, managment of versions, and the acquisition and publication of source and document files. A Remote Repository adds the capability to access the Repository's functionality over a communication channel, e.g., interprocess communication, inter-network communication, and communication across the internet. 

In this application, a Remote Code Repository, local Client, and communication channel that supports client access to the Repository from any internet enabled processor. 

The communication channel will use sockets and support an HTTP like message structure. The channel could support: 
* HTTP style request/response transactions 
* One-way communication, allowing asynchronous messaging between any two endpoints that are capable of listening for connection requests and connecting to a remote listener. 
* Transmission of byte streams that are set up with one or more negotiation messages followed by transmission of a stream of bytes of specified stream size2. 
* One way asynchronous communication is required, and file transfer using messages with binary bodies.
